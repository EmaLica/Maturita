## Edward Snowden
In 2013, **Edward Snowden**, a former intelligence contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), revealed the existence of previously highly classified intelligence-gathering surveillance programs run by the NSA and the U.K.’s equivalent, the GCHQ. While working at the NSA, Snowden began accumulating information on NSA surveillance programs and activities while contracted there from 2009 to 2013.

**In May 2013**, Snowden flew to Hong Kong where he brought **NSA documents to reporters at _The Guardian_**, who conducted interviews of Snowden about his discoveries. With _The Guardian_ and _The Washington Post_ publishing reports on NSA surveillance and data-collecting activities, Snowden revealed his identity shortly thereafter. In June 2013, the U.S. government charged Snowden with espionage under the Espionage Act and attempted to extradite him. However, with the Hong Kong government not taking any action with regard to his extradition, Snowden fled to Russia where he has since remained.

Snowden’s discoveries drew open the curtain on many classified NSA programs including PRISM, an undercover data-mining **operation that collected private data** of users **from companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and AOL**. Additionally, included in Snowden’s exposures was an NSA court order compelling internet service provider, Verizon, to turn over metadata for millions of its users.

In August 2013, President Obama announced proposed reforms to increase transparency of NSA and other agency programs, including updating sections of the Patriot Act and reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Additionally, President Obama convened an independent panel of outside experts to examine the U.S. government’s surveillance technologies and practices. In December 2013, the panel found that the **NSA should not be permitted to collect personal data and information from Internet service providers and phone carriers**, among other recommendations.

### Programmi rivelati
Edward Snowden revealed several government surveillance programs conducted by intelligence agencies, particularly the United States' National Security Agency (NSA). His disclosures uncovered the existence of a vast global surveillance system that involved both US citizens and foreigners.

Among the main programs he revealed were:

1. **PRISM**: A surveillance program that allowed the NSA to access data from numerous internet services, including Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Through PRISM, the agency had access to personal information such as emails, photos, videos, and chats.
2. **XKeyscore**: A surveillance system that enabled the NSA to monitor real-time communications and access a vast amount of data, including emails, text messages, chats, browsing history, and location information.
3. **Boundless Informant**: A program used to collect, analyze, and visualize surveillance data gathered by the NSA. Boundless Informant provided a comprehensive overview of the agency's surveillance activities, including details on the amount of data collected from each country.
4. **Tempora**: A surveillance program conducted by the United Kingdom's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), in collaboration with the NSA. Tempora intercepted and stored enormous amounts of communication data from fiber optic cables crossing the Atlantic Ocean.
5. **Upstream collection**: A communications interception program involving the monitoring of internet traffic passing through major communication nodes in the United States. This allowed the NSA to intercept and analyze global internet traffic.

These revelations raised concerns about **privacy, civil rights, and the extent of government surveillance activities**.
